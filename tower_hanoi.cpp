 Project: Resolving the Tower of hanoi using recursion
 
 
 
A. How the game is played: All the disks on the origin tower (A) have to me moved to the final tower(c) by movng only one disk at a time and by also making sure to place a larger on top of a smaller one.
 
B. The objective of the program: is to design an executable program that solves the tower of Hanoi puzzle (step by step)and record the execution time (in seconds) with different number of disks.
 
C. Algorithm and strategy: here is how i plan to reolve the puzzle:

    0. Record pre-execution time
    1. Move a tower of Num_Disks-1 to an auxilliary pole, using the final pole.
    2. Move the remaining disk to the final pole (C).
    3. Move the tower of Num_Disks-1 from the intermediate pole to the final pole using the original pole
    4. Record post-execution time
 
D. Pseudocode:
 
 If Num_Disks == 1 : Move disk from origin (A) to finalDestination (B)
 
    else if (Num_Disks > 1)
 
 Tower_Hanoi (Num_Disks-1, origin, finalDestination, aux)
 Move disk from origin to finalDestination
 Tower_Of_Hanoi (Num_Disks-1, aux, finalDestination, origin)

 Case 1: 3 disks
 
 OUTPUT:
 
 Enter the number of disks : 3
 The sequence of moves involved in the Tower of Hanoi are :
 
 Move disk 1 from towerr A to towerr C
 Move disk 2 from tower A to tower B
 Move disk 1 from towerr C to towerr B
 Move disk 3 from tower A to tower C
 Move disk 1 from towerr B to towerr A
 Move disk 2 from tower B to tower C
 Move disk 1 from towerr A to towerr C
 Execution time: 0 seconds
 Program ended with exit code: 0
 
 Case 2: 15 disks
 Since it requires minimum (2^15 - 1) moves to resolve the puzzle, only the two first moves, two last moves and execution time will be copied in the output
 
 OUTPUT:
 
 Enter the number of disks : 15
 The sequence of moves involved in the Tower of Hanoi are :
 
 Move disk 1 from towerr A to towerr C
 Move disk 2 from tower A to tower B
               .
               .
               .
 
 Move disk 2 from tower B to tower C
 Move disk 1 from towerr A to towerr C
 Execution time: 1 seconds
 
 Case 3: 20 disks
 Since it requires minimum (2^20 - 1) moves to resolve the puzzle, only the two first moves, two last moves and execution time will be copied in the output
 
OUTPUT:
 Enter the number of disks : 20
 The sequence of moves involved in the Tower of Hanoi are :
 
 Move disk 1 from towerr A to towerr B
 Move disk 2 from tower A to tower C
               .
               .
               .
 Move disk 2 from tower A to tower C
 Move disk 1 from towerr B to towerr C
 Execution time: 9 seconds
 
 ----------------------------------------------
 
 Conclusion: More disks to be moved from the original tower to the final destination, more processing and execution it will take the computer to lay out the steps and resolve the tower of Hanoi puzzle.
